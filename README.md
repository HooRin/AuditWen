## Introduction
The first Chinese open-source audit model was developed by the School of Computer Science at Nanjing Audit University, based on Qwen-7B-chat and fine-tuning massive supervised audit related data. Having extensive audit knowledge and intelligent analysis capabilities, this model aims to provide comprehensive and effective problem analysis and audit basis recommendation support for the audit field.

## Explain
1. This project is still constantly iterating and updating. Considering the wide coverage of the audit field and the serious shortage of domain dataset resources, we have only released fine-tuning models on the audit laws, regulations, and qualitative question and answer datasets;
2. The data and models provided in this project are for scientific research purposes only and are strictly prohibited from being used for commercial purposes;
